# Sprint Challenge: Theory of Computation and Hash Tables

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored Computation Theory and Hash Tables. During this Sprint, you studied state machines, boolean algebra, hash tables and continued your exploration of the C programming language. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by designing a state machine, filling out boolean truth tables and solving algorithms in C using hash tables.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency in C and your command of the concepts and techniques in the computation theory and hash tables.

You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons and your project manager.

## Description

This sprint challenge is divided up into three parts: State machines (5 points), boolean algebra (4 points) and hash tables (10 points). The point values correspond to approximately how much time you should spend on each. There is also a stretch goal in the boolean algebra which should only be attempted after the rest of the problems have been completed.


## Self-Study/Essay Questions

You should be able to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions.

- Describe the structure and basic methods of a hash table
- Describe how a hash table works
- What is a memory leak and how can they be prevented in C?
- What are some ways to determine the truth table for a boolean expression?

You are expected to be able to answer all these questions.


## Project Set Up

#### [Theory of Computation](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Sprint-Challenge--Hash-Theory/tree/master/theory)

For the state machines portion, you will need a way to draw state machines. A useful tool for drawing state machines is [Evan's FSM Designer](http://madebyevan.com/fsm/). Alternatively, you can draw your state machine with a pencil/paper and upload a picture.

For the boolean algebra section, you can either copy your answers into a new text file or fill out the README with your solutions. Just make sure your PM knows where to find them.

#### [Hash Tables](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Sprint-Challenge--Hash-Theory/tree/master/hash-tables)

For the hash tables portion of the sprint challenge, you'll be working through some algorithm problems that are amenable to being solved efficiently using a hash table. You know the drill at this point. Navigate into each exercise's directory, read the instructions for the exercise laid out in the README, implement your solution in the .c skeleton file, then make sure your code passes the tests by running the test script with make tests.

A hash table implementation has been included for you already. Your task is to get the tests passing (ideally using a hash table to do it). You can remind yourself of what hash table functions are available by looking at the hashtable.h header file that is included in each exercise directory (note that the hash table implementations for both exercises differ slightly).

## Minimum Viable Product

You will achieve MVP for this challenge by earning 14 points, which will be awarded as follows:


#### [Theory of Computation](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Sprint-Challenge--Hash-Theory/tree/master/theory) - 9 pts
  * State Machine - 5 pts
  * Boolean 1 - 1 pt
  * Boolean 2 - 1 pt
  * Boolean 3 - 2 pt

#### [Hash Tables](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Sprint-Challenge--Hash-Theory/tree/master/hash-tables) - 10 pts
  * ex1 - 5 pts
  * ex2 - 5 pts

Both Hash Table problems will be graded as follows:
  * 1: Code attempted
  * 2: Code resembles the correct solution
  * 3: Tests pass
  * 4: Tests pass, no hash table memory leaks
  * 5: Tests pass, no hash table memory leaks, linear runtime complexity  


#### [Computation Stretch](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Sprint-Challenge--Hash-Theory/tree/master/theory) - 4 pts
  * Truth Table - 1 pt
  * Sum - 1 pt
  * Carry - 2 pts

Stretch points will only be counted if all other problems have been completed.

### Grading
  * __1__: 0-13
  * __2__: 14-19
  * __3__: 20+

If you are close to passing but just a couple of points short of MVP (12-13), your PM can add up to 2 points to your score based on your answers AND participation and completion of your homework assignment for the week.


## Stretch Problems

The stretch goal can be found in the [Theory of Computation](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Sprint-Challenge--Hash-Theory/tree/master/theory) section.
