# Sprint Challenge: TOPIC - Theory of Computation and Hash Tables

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored Computation Theory and Hash Tables. During this Sprint, you studied state machines, boolean algebra, hash tables and continued your exploration of the C programming language. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by designing a state machine, filling out boolean truth tables and solving algorithms in C using hash tables.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency in C and your command of the concepts and techniques in the computation theory and hash tables.

You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Commits

[Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons and your project manager.]

## Description

This sprint challenge is divided up into three parts: State machines (5 points), boolean algebra (4 points) and hash tables (10 points). The point values correspond to approximately how much time you should spend on each. There is also a stretch goal in the boolean algebra which should only be attempted after the rest of the problems have been completed. They will be graded as follows:

#### (Theory of Computation)[https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Sprint-Challenge--Hash-Theory/tree/master/theory] - 9 pts
  * State Machine - 5 pts
  * Boolean 1 - 1 pt
  * Boolean 2 - 1 pt
  * Boolean 3 - 2 pt

#### (Hash Tables)[https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Sprint-Challenge--Hash-Theory/tree/master/hash-tables] - 10 pts
  * ex1 - 5 pts
  * ex2 - 5 pts

#### (Computation Stretch)[https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Sprint-Challenge--Hash-Theory/tree/master/theory] - 4 pts
  * Truth Table - 1 pt
  * Sum - 1 pt
  * Carry - 2 pts

Stretch points will only be counted if all other problems have been completed.

### Grading
  * 1: 0-14
  * 2: 15-19
  * 3: 20+
